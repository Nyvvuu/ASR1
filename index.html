          Since our founding in 1998, Alpha Sigma Rho has expanded to twelve universities and has hundreds of active and alumnae sisters across the globe. Our organization has grown from a group of twelve women with a mission to spread sisterhood and Asian-awareness, to a strong organization that still embraces our founding mission. Above all else, we cherish that we have each other to call sisters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since our establishment, Alpha Sigma Rho has included sisters of all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds. We still endeavor to promote Asian awareness, but we understand that Asian heritage is not a requirement to promote it. We treasure and cherish the differences in our sisters by being respectful, true, and committed to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          We never leave a sister behind because we share more than just letters and traditions; we share dreams, goals, and a lasting sisterhood that has survived the ages. We are about empowering womanhood, experiencing new adventures with sisters, and building long-lasting friendships.
